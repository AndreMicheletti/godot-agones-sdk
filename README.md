# (Unofficial) Agones SDK for Godot
### Version 0.1.0

Welcome to the unofficial [Agones](https://agones.dev/site/) SDK for [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).

[Agones](https://agones.dev/site/) is an open source, batteries-included, multiplayer dedicated game server scaling and orchestration platform that can run anywhere Kubernetes can run.

This plugin allows your Godot Scripts communicate with [Agones SDK Server](https://agones.dev/site/docs/guides/client-sdks/) by wrapping its REST API and giving you simple **GDScript** functions to use in your scripts.

> Only GDScript is supported for now
